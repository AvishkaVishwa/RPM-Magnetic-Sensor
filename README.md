## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Operational Logic

This circuit controls motor speed by varying the **duty cycle** of a **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** signal generated by the NE555 timer IC operating in **astable mode** (meaning it produces a continuous oscillating output).

1.  **PWM Generation (NE555):**
    *   The NE555 timer generates a square wave signal at its output (Pin 3). The frequency and duty cycle of this wave are determined by the timing components: Potentiometer (R1), Resistor (R2), and Capacitor (C2).
    *   **Charging Phase (Output HIGH):** Capacitor C2 charges through R2 and the upper part of the potentiometer R1 via diode D1. The duration of this phase sets the **ON time (T_H)** of the PWM signal.
    *   **Discharging Phase (Output LOW):** Capacitor C2 discharges through the lower part of the potentiometer R1 via diode D2 and into the NE555's Discharge pin (Pin 7). The duration of this phase sets the **OFF time (T_L)** of the PWM signal.
    *   **Duty Cycle Adjustment:** By turning the potentiometer (R1), the resistance in the charge path (upper part of R1 + R2) and discharge path (lower part of R1) changes. This alters the ratio of T_H to T_L, thus changing the PWM duty cycle without significantly changing the frequency. A higher duty cycle means the output is HIGH for longer.

2.  **Motor Driving (MOSFET Q1):**
    *   The PWM signal from the NE555's output (Pin 3) is connected to the **Gate** of the N-channel MOSFET (Q1) via resistor R3 (which limits gate current).
    *   **Output HIGH:** When the NE555 output is HIGH, the MOSFET Gate is driven HIGH, turning the MOSFET **ON**. This allows current to flow from the 12V supply (VCC), through the motor (connected to J2), through the MOSFET (Drain to Source), and to Ground (GND). The motor receives power.
    *   **Output LOW:** When the NE555 output is LOW, the MOSFET Gate is driven LOW, turning the MOSFET **OFF**. This interrupts the current flow to the motor. Resistor R4 helps ensure the gate discharges quickly, turning the MOSFET off reliably.
    *   **Speed Control:** By rapidly switching the motor ON and OFF according to the PWM duty cycle, the *average* voltage supplied to the motor is controlled. A higher duty cycle results in a higher average voltage and faster motor speed. A lower duty cycle results in lower average voltage and slower speed.

3.  **Motor Protection (Diode D4):**
    *   The Schottky diode D4 (SS14) is connected in parallel with the motor but in the reverse direction (cathode to VCC, anode to MOSFET Drain). This is a **flyback diode**.
    *   When the MOSFET turns OFF, the collapsing magnetic field in the motor's coils induces a voltage spike (back EMF) in the opposite polarity. The flyback diode provides a path for this induced current to circulate safely, preventing the high voltage spike from damaging the MOSFET.

### üî£ Timing Equations (Astable Mode with Diodes)

The use of diodes D1 and D2 slightly modifies the standard NE555 astable equations. Assuming R1 is the total potentiometer resistance (e.g., 10kŒ©) and 'x' is the fraction of R1 set by the wiper (0 to 1):

- **Resistance during Charge:** `R_charge = R2 + x * R1`
- **Resistance during Discharge:** `R_discharge = (1 - x) * R1`

- **Time High (ON):** (Capacitor C2 charges through D1, R2, and upper part of R1)
  \[
  T_H \approx 0.693 \cdot (R2 + x \cdot R1) \cdot C2
  \]

- **Time Low (OFF):** (Capacitor C2 discharges through D2 and lower part of R1)
  \[
  T_L \approx 0.693 \cdot (1 - x) \cdot R1 \cdot C2
  \]

- **Total Period:**
  \[
  T = T_H + T_L
  \]

- **Frequency:**
  \[
  f = \frac{1}{T}
  \]
  *(Note: Frequency will vary slightly as the potentiometer is adjusted)*

- **Duty Cycle:**
  \[
  D = \frac{T_H}{T} \times 100\% = \frac{R2 + x \cdot R1}{R2 + R1} \times 100\%
  \]
  *(This shows duty cycle is primarily controlled by the potentiometer position 'x')*

## üîÅ PWM Motor Speed Control Example

Using component values from simulation or schematic:

- **R1 (Potentiometer) = 10kŒ©**, **R2 = 1kŒ©**, **C2 = 0.1¬µF** (Assuming C2 is the timing cap, adjust if different in schematic)
- Let potentiometer be set at **midpoint (x = 0.5)**:
  - `R_charge = 1kŒ© + 0.5 * 10kŒ© = 6kŒ©`
  - `R_discharge = (1 - 0.5) * 10kŒ© = 5kŒ©`
- **Time High (T_H) ‚âà 0.693 * 6kŒ© * 0.1¬µF ‚âà 0.4158 ms**
- **Time Low (T_L) ‚âà 0.693 * 5kŒ© * 0.1¬µF ‚âà 0.3465 ms**
- **Total Period (T) ‚âà 0.4158 + 0.3465 ‚âà 0.7623 ms**
- **Frequency (f) ‚âà 1 / 0.0007623 s ‚âà 1312 Hz**
- **Duty Cycle (D) ‚âà (0.4158 / 0.7623) * 100% ‚âà 54.5%**

### üîÑ Speed Estimation

Assuming:
- Motor rated speed at 12V = **3000 RPM**
- Speed is roughly linear with average voltage (duty cycle)

Then at **54.5% duty cycle**:

\[
    ext{Estimated RPM} = 3000 	imes 0.545 = \boxed{1635 	ext{ RPM}}
\]
*(Note: Actual speed depends heavily on motor characteristics and load)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Suggestions for Improvement

- **MOSFET Choice:** Use **IRLZ44N** (logic-level gate) instead of IRFZ44N if driving directly from a 3.3V/5V microcontroller in other projects. For this NE555 circuit (powered likely >5V), IRFZ44N is often acceptable, but IRLZ44N offers lower gate threshold voltage.
- **Gate Resistor:** Add a **10kŒ© pull-down resistor** from the MOSFET Gate (Pin 1 of Q1) to Ground (GND). This ensures the MOSFET stays OFF during power-up or if the NE555 output is temporarily undefined.
- **Decoupling:** Include a **0.1¬µF ceramic capacitor (C3)** directly across the NE555 VCC (Pin 8) and GND (Pin 1) pins to filter noise and improve stability.
- **Heatsink:** Add a heatsink to the **MOSFET (Q1)** if the motor draws significant current (e.g., > 1-2 Amps continuously) to prevent overheating.
- **Input Protection:** Consider adding reverse polarity protection (e.g., a diode or P-channel MOSFET) at the input power jack (J1).

## üñ•Ô∏è PCB Layout

A compact 2-layer layout using KiCAD. Power traces (VCC, GND, Motor connections) should be made wide enough to handle the expected motor current. The flyback diode (D4) should be placed physically close to the motor terminals (J2).
